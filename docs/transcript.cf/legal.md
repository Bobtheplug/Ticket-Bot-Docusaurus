# ðŸ’¾ How we store the data

When you upload a transcript to the api we store all the messages (included images if your request size is less than 20MB), the users id, the channel id, the guild id for lifetime.  
If you want to delete your data you can contact us by mail: [ticketbot+data@ik.me](mailto:ticketbot+data@ik.me)

# üêã Docker Setup

Hellow fellow docker mates. So the setup for docker isn't terribly hard, matter of fact, might be easier than normal setup.

## Standard Setup
1. Please visit the [config doc](https://doc.ticket.pm/docs/config#general-configuration) (ignore the .env section) to setup your configuration file
2. Modify the locales if needed
3. Boot up the container
    * For Linux, run: `TOKEN=[REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR DISCORD TOKEN] docker compose up -d`
    * For Windows, export env variable for `TOKEN`, then run `docker compose up -d`

## Data directory
All of the data are stored in `/opt/ticket-bot/` (including bot's config file).

## Updates
* For any source updates, rebuild the container using `docker compose up -d --build`
* To update config files, go to the data directory `/opt/ticket-bot/config` and update it there; make sure to restart the container when finish making changes.
